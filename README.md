# DES391-1 Modding Assignment

The game has a digital version  hosted here to [play]().
## 1. The original Idea
 * The original game was based around the idea of arranging four quadrants (with different patterns) on the board in such a way that it forms a full circle. If all the four quadrants are made of same pattern, the player gets bonus points. 
 * The player can either turn a quadrant, add a quadrant, remove a quadrant by adding the same pattern.
 * The player who finishes his cards first gets eliminated.
 * Yellow sqaure leads to bonus bonus. <br><br>
